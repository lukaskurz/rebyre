# rebyre

Just a small tool I wrote for doing refutiation by resolution, on a proposition in CNF.

## Usage

Call the `solve` command and point it to an input file, the rest is magic (not really).

```bash
$ rebyre solve example_input.boole
```

Input has to be written in CNF, logical `and` as a `&` and logical `or` as a `|`.
For more info regarding the input format, view the example_input.boole file.

If you want to see more details on the resolution process the program does, add the `verbose` flag. It then prints out each clause that it finds, together with an id and the clauses that were used to derive the clause.

```
id | name            | id of clause a | id of clause b
1  | ( x | !d | !a ) |                |
2  | ( !c | a | !d ) |                |
3  | ( c | !z | y )  |                |
...| ...             | ...            |
16 | ( x | !d | !c ) | 1              | 2


```

## Example

```bash
rebyre on ÓÇ† main via üêπ v1.13.15 
‚ûú rebyre solve example_input.boole
Starting resolution:
Found an empty clause !!

Solution #0

(  )‚î¨( x )‚î¨( x | !c )‚î¨( x | !d | !c )‚î¨( x | !d | !a )
    |     |          |               ‚îî( !c | a | !d )
    |     |          ‚îî( x | d | !c )‚î¨( x | d | a )
    |     |                         ‚îî( d | !c | !a )
    |     ‚îî( c | x )‚î¨( c | y )‚î¨( c | !z | y )
    |               |         ‚îî( z )
    |               ‚îî( x | !y )‚î¨( x | !b | !y )

           |           |           ‚îî( z )
           |           ‚îî( y | !x )‚î¨( y | !b | !x )
           |                      ‚îî( b )
           ‚îî( !x | c )‚î¨( !x | !a | c )‚î¨( !x | !a | d )
                      |               ‚îî( !a | !d | c )
                      ‚îî( a | c )‚î¨( !d | a | c )
                                ‚îî( d | c | a )
